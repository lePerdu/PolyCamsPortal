# PolyCamsPortal
A mobile application for Florida Poly Students that will pull the userâ€™s class schedule from the CAMS web portal, and store it in the app locally for a convenient way of generating possible schedules and accessing/viewing them once created. It will have filtering options to specify times, days, professors, etc. that a student wants to have or avoid in order to narrow down the generated list. Additional functionalities may include being able to share your schedule, adding classes to Google Calendar, or register for classes from within the app.
